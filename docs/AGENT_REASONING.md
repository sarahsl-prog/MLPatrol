# Agent Reasoning System

## How MLPatrol Thinks

### Reasoning Chain Example
```
User Query: "Check my environment for numpy vulnerabilities"

Agent Reasoning:
Step 1: Identify task type -> CVE monitoring
Step 2: Search for numpy CVEs from last 30 days
Step 3: Filter by severity and relevance
Step 4: Analyze exploit mechanisms
Step 5: Generate checking code
Step 6: Provide remediation guidance
```
